# Financial Situation & Retail Performance Analysis
This project provides an end-to-end financial analysis of retail operations, focusing on profitability and business sustainability. By analyzing data across four key dimensions (Seasons, Regions, States, and Categories), this dashboard identifies financial leaks and growth opportunities.

A core focus of this project is CX (Customer Experience) Optimization—distinguishing high-value customer segments from underperforming ones to drive better business outcomes.
